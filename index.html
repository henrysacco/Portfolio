        <h2>About Me</h2>
        John started his professional career as an Army Ranger in 1986 specializing in 
        Tactical Communications. Although stationed in Washington, he spent considerable 
        time deployed to Central America and Europe. After separating in 1990, he used his
        military background to secure his first job in technology, installing 911 systems. 
        His career slowly transitioned to Information Technology as he found a greater 
        opportunity for growth and development.
